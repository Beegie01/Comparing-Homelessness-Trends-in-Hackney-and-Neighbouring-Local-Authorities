### RECOMMENDATIONS<br>
1. Educate households on importance of encouraging friends or family members to apply early for their own housing options while relationships are still positive.
2. Encourage household members to report early signs of domestic abuse to help identify potential risks of homelessness and enable timely preventive measures.
3. Strengthen the councilâ€™s capacity to secure accommodation and expand its use of LA/HA stock to reduce reliance on more expensive alternatives.
4. Direct greater investment towards reducing the length of time families spend in temporary accommodation, in order to minimize the negative impact on growing children.
5. Investigate the root causes of unexpectedly high use of temporary accommodation by  single adult males.
